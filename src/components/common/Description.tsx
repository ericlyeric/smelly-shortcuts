        The motivation behind this project was to learn keyboard shortcuts for platforms shown on
        the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intended use case is to have this page open as a reference while working in the
        respective platforms
      </p>
      <p>More shortcuts and platforms may be added in the future.</p>
